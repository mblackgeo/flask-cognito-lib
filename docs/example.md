# Example Flask application

A separate repo holds [a complete example app](https://github.com/mblackgeo/flask-cognito-jwt-example), including AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) code to deploy the application to API Gateway and Lambda, along with creation of a Cognito User Pool and Client.

However, a minimal example application is shown below that demonstrates the features:

```py title="app.py"
{! app.py !}
```

Requirements file:

```py title="requirements.txt"
{! requirements.txt !}
