A Flask extension that supports protecting routes with AWS Cognito following [OAuth 2.1 best practices](https://oauth.net/2.1/). That means the full authorization code flow, including Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636) to prevent Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), along with secure storage of access tokens in HTTP only cookies (to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks), and additional `nonce` validation (if using ID tokens) to prevent replay attacks.

Optionally, OAuth refresh flow can be enabled, with the refresh token stored in a HTTP-only cookie with optional Fernet symmetrical encryption using Flask's `SECRET_KEY` (encryption is enabled by default).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install:

```bash
pip install flask-cognito-lib
```


## Quick start

A complete example Flask application is provided in [`/example`](example/) including instructions on setting up a Cognito User Pool. Assuming a Cognito user pool has been setup, with an app client (with Client ID and Secret), get started as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, redirect, session, url_for

from flask_cognito_lib import CognitoAuth
from flask_cognito_lib.decorators import (
    auth_required,
    cognito_login,
    cognito_login_callback,
    cognito_logout,
    cognito_refresh_callback,
)

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration required for CognitoAuth
app.config["AWS_REGION"] = "eu-west-1"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID"] = "eu-west-1_qwerty"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_DOMAIN"] = "https://app.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID"] = "asdfghjkl1234asdf"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_SECRET"] = "zxcvbnm1234567890"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URL"] = "https://example.com/postlogin"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_LOGOUT_URL"] = "https://example.com/postlogout"
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_REFRESH_FLOW_ENABLED"] = True
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_REFRESH_COOKIE_ENCRYPTED"] = True
app.config["AWS_COGNITO_REFRESH_COOKIE_AGE_SECONDS"] = 86400

auth = CognitoAuth(app)


@app.route("/login")
@cognito_login
def login():
    # A simple route that will redirect to the Cognito Hosted UI.
    # No logic is required as the decorator handles the redirect to the Cognito
    # hosted UI for the user to sign in.
    # An optional "state" value can be set in the current session which will
    # be passed and then used in the postlogin route (after the user has logged
    # into the Cognito hosted UI); this could be used for dynamic redirects,
    # for example, set `session['state'] = "some_custom_value"` before passing
    # the user to this route
    pass


@app.route("/postlogin")
@cognito_login_callback
def postlogin():
    # A route to handle the redirect after a user has logged in with Cognito.
    # This route must be set as one of the User Pool client's Callback URLs in
    # the Cognito console and also as the config value AWS_COGNITO_REDIRECT_URL.
    # The decorator will store the validated access token in a HTTP only cookie
    # and the user claims and info are stored in the Flask session:
    # session["claims"] and session["user_info"].
    # Do anything after the user has logged in here, e.g. a redirect or perform
    # logic based on a custom `session['state']` value if that was set before
    # login
    return redirect(url_for("claims"))


@app.route("/refresh", methods=["POST"])
@cognito_refresh_callback
def refresh():
    # A route to handle the token refresh with Cognito.
    # The decorator will exchange the refresh token for new access and refresh tokens.
    # The new validated access token will be stored in an HTTP only secure cookie.
    # The refresh token will be symmetrically encrypted(by default)
    # and stored in an HTTP only secure cookie.
    # The user claims and info are stored in the Flask session:
    # session["claims"] and session["user_info"].
    # Do anything after the user has refreshed access token here, e.g. a redirect
    # or perform logic based on the `session["user_info"]`.
    pass


@app.route("/claims")
@auth_required()
def claims():
    # This route is protected by the Cognito authorisation. If the user is not
    # logged in at this point or their token from Cognito is no longer valid
    # a 401 Authentication Error is thrown, which can be caught by registering
    # an `@app.error_handler(AuthorisationRequiredError)`.
    # If their session is valid, the current session will be shown including
    # their claims and user_info extracted from the Cognito tokens.
    return jsonify(session)


@app.route("/admin")
@auth_required(groups=["admin"])
def admin():
    # This route will only be accessible to a user who is a member of all of
    # groups specified in the "groups" argument on the auth_required decorator
    # If they are not, a 401 Authentication Error is thrown, which can be caught
    # by registering an `@app.error_handler(CognitoGroupRequiredError)`.
    # If their session is valid, the set of groups the user is a member of will be
    # shown.

    # Could also use: jsonify(session["user_info"]["cognito:groups"])
    return jsonify(session["claims"]["cognito:groups"])


@app.route("/edit")
@auth_required(groups=["admin", "editor"], any_group=True)
def edit():
    # This route will only be accessible to a user who is a member of any of
    # groups specified in the "groups" argument on the auth_required decorator
    # If they are not, a CognitoGroupRequiredError is raised.
    return jsonify(session["claims"]["cognito:groups"])


@app.route("/logout")
@cognito_logout
def logout():
    # Logout of the Cognito User pool and delete the cookies that were set
    # on login.
    # Revokes the refresh token to not be used again and removes the cookie.
    # No logic is required here as it simply redirects to Cognito.
    pass


@app.route("/postlogout")
def postlogout():
    # This is the endpoint Cognito redirects to after a user has logged out,
    # handle any logic here, like returning to the homepage.
    # This route must be set as one of the User Pool client's Sign Out URLs.
    return redirect(url_for("home"))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Credits

This work started as a fork of the unmaintained [Flask-AWSCognito](https://github.com/cgauge/Flask-AWSCognito) extension, revising the implementation following OAuth 2.1 recommendations, with inspiration from [flask-cognito-auth](https://github.com/shrivastava-v-ankit/flask-cognito-auth). Whilst there are serveral Cognito extensions available for Flask, none of those implement OAuth 2.1 recommendations, with some plugins not even actively maintained.
